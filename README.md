### About this repository
This document contains the Project assignment for 2021 Machine Learning & Statistics module at GMIT{[1]. [See the instructions here.](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/assessment-2122-machstat/blob/main/assessment.pdf)

#### Goal
The goal of this project is to help me become able to to discover patterns in real world data measurements, choose the appropriate models and functions of machine learning and make predictions based on often complex patterns to answer business questions, detect and analyse trends and help solve real-world problems. I will achieve this by exploring, understanding and demonstrating two Python[2] libraries, namely Scikit-Learn [3] and Scipy Stats [4], via Jupyter Notebooks [5]. 
In addition, Standards and guidelines for Quality Assurance at GMIT are strictly followed. [6] 

#### Files
In this repository you can find a few files; two Jupyter Notebooks

* **scikit-learn.ipynb** - containing a demonstrations and visualisations of my three favorite algorithms available through scikit-learn Python library;

* **scipy-stats.ipynb** - containing a demonstration and visualisation of a hypothesis testing using ANOVA, available through scipy-stats Python library; 
Structure of each notebook will be further explained in the below sections. Furthermore, file **requirements.txt** is required for interactive usage of the notebooks.
